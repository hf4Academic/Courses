This folder will contain reading materials, reference documents, and some excellent assignments and cases from students (with their consent to be made public) for the courses that I teach. 

Each folder will correspond to a specific course. If you wish to use these materials, please acknowledge the copyright. 

Everyone is also welcome to raise issues to help improve the course construction.
